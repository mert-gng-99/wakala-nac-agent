# Wakala - demo video script

Target: **3 minutes**. Screen recording of the running app with a voice-over.
Record at 1920x1080, browser zoomed so the three columns are readable.

Before recording: `uvicorn main:app --port 8000`, open the dashboard, press
**Clear ledger** so the metric strip starts at zero.

## 0:00-0:25 - The problem

> "A property sale needs stronger proof than an address change. Wakala buys proof in proportion to the act and hands the notary a report, not a decision."

On screen: the dashboard, still empty. Let the header sit for a moment so the
product name, the theme and the CAMARA API count register.

## 0:25-1:00 - One case, start to finish

Click **Change of address on file**.

> "The agent is handed a case and decides which network question is worth
> asking. It does not call every API, because each one costs money and reveals
> something about a person."

Point at the step list as it fills.

> "One call at a time, with the reason it chose that call. Here is the CAMARA
> answer, and here is what the agent concluded from it."

Scroll to the evidence table.

> "Every answer is tagged with where it came from. This is simulator mode, and
> it says so. A simulated answer never passes itself off as a real one."

Point at the two badges in the header while you say it. They read the mode and
the planner straight from the running service, so they say `simulator answers`
and `policy planner` on a default deployment, and `live network` and
`gemini verified` once real credentials are in place. Judges get the honest
state of your deployment in one glance, which is worth more than a claim.

## 1:00-1:40 - Restraint is the product

Click **Run all seven acts**.

> "All 7 scenarios. Every one reached the outcome it claims, and the
> demo asserts the same thing the test suite does."

Point at the cost line.

> "56 units spent. Calling every available check on every case would
> have cost 98. That is 42.9% saved, and look at the spread:
> *Change of address on file* took 1 call, *Property sale, SIM changed two days ago* earned 7. An
> agent that checks everyone is safe, useless and unaffordable."

## 1:40-2:15 - Consent is real

Press **Withdraw consent**, then re-run the same scenario.

> "CAMARA location and identity APIs need the consent of the line owner. That
> is enforced in the transport layer, not promised in a policy document."

Point at the empty evidence table and the refusal list.

> "Zero calls. The agent is refused before a request is even built."

Press **Restore**.

## 2:15-2:45 - The guardrail

> "With a Gemini key the model chooses the calls. But the policy computes a
> floor from the evidence alone, and if the model proposes something less
> cautious, the floor wins and the disagreement is recorded."

Optionally show `tests/test_agent.py::test_the_floor_overrides_an_over_confident_model`.

> "A language model should decide which checks to buy. It should not be able to
> clear a case the evidence says to escalate. There is a test for that."

## 2:45-3:00 - Close

> "Wakala. Network proof that lets a citizen abroad sign a legal act. 5 CAMARA APIs on Nokia Network as Code,
> an agent layer that spends against a budget, and a record that explains every
> decision to the person it affects."

## If you have 30 seconds more

Run the light act first to show one unit of spend, then the property sale with the fresh SIM change. The contrast between the two is the pitch.

## Notes

- Say "simulator mode" out loud. Judges who know CAMARA will wonder, and
  answering before they ask reads as confidence.
- The honest limits in README.md are worth 15 seconds if the video runs short.
  Stating what a product cannot do is unusual enough to be memorable.
- Scenarios worth using: Change of address on file, Register a company from abroad, Sell an inherited flat
